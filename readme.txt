vgmstream

This is vgmstream, a library for playing streamed audio from video games.
It is very much under development. The only end-user part right now is the test program, simply called "test" (test.exe for Windows), which decodes a file to a standard .wav output file.

Formats supported by this version of vgmstream (r26):
- ADX (CRI ADX ADPCM)
- .brstm (RSTM: GC/Wii ADPCM, 8/16 bit PCM)
- .strm (STRM: NDS IMA ADPCM, 8/16 bit PCM)
- .adp (GC DTK ADPCM)
- .agsc (GC ADPCM)

Enjoy!
